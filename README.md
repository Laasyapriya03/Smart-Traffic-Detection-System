This project aims to detect, classify, and track the movement of pedestrians, vehicles, and pets (specifically cats and dogs) in a video feed using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once Version 8) and OpenCV.

It also estimates the speed of each detected object in real-time, providing valuable insights into traffic behavior, pedestrian movement, or pet activities in a monitored area.

The primary goal is to develop an intelligent monitoring system that can:

Detect specific object types in a video.

Track their movement across frames.

Estimate their speeds based on frame-by-frame displacement.

This system could be adapted for use in traffic monitoring, urban surveillance, campus security, or smart pet monitoring systems.
